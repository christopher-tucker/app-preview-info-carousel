# when you create the new postgres instance:

# use this ami id:
ami-024def4b62933fe1c

# login to the machine
ssh -i ~/Downloads/sdc-host.pem ubuntu@3.133.82.52
# NOTE: the above ip address is taken from the address of the newly created instance (shown in the aws console)

# pull down / run the docker image with:
sudo docker run -d -e PGHOST=3.133.82.52 -p 3003:3003 --restart unless-stopped christuckerdocker/postgres-node-proxy:node-carousel-app
# NOTE: the above ip address and host is of the current running postgres instance, found in aws dashboard

# in the aws console, edit the security group incoming rules on both the carousel-server instance and the instance with postgres on it
